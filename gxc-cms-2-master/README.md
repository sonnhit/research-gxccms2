GXC-CMS-2
=========

Hello and welcome to the new version of GXC-CMS.

Please follow these steps to getting started:
1/ Check out gxc-cms source code at: https://github.com/nganhtuan63/GXC-CMS-2

For example: I checked out source code at /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/gxccms

2/ Use command line to generate new app:

- php /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/gxccms/core/cms/cms.php cmsapp /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/project1

(generate a new project from gxc-cms)

3/ Install the app, Go to:

http://localhost/project1/backend/install to install.
(The installer will check if .locked file existed in common folder or not before installing).
